**Metrics**:

- *Count*. The total number of students in each group, as well as the number of identified students in both the baseline system and via Optimal Identification.

- *Proportion identified*. The proportion of students in each group who are identified.

$$\text{Proportion identified} = \frac{\text{number of students in group and identified}}{\text{number of students in group}}$$

- *Representation Index*. Measures a group's representation in the gifted program relative to their proportion in the district or school population. Values near 1 indicate proportional representation; less than 1 indicate underrepresentation.

$$\text{Representation index} = \frac{\text{Proportion of gifted students in a group}}{\text{Proportion of population in a group}}$$

For example, if African American students are 20% of the gifted population but 40% of the district population, then $RI = \frac{.2}{.4} = 0.5$

- *Relative Risk*.
